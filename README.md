# Lung_capicity
The dataset provides information on the lung capacity of children and kids between 3 and 19 y.o. plus other features, including the gender, height, smoking habits â€¦ This dataset can be used to do either a regression or a statistical analysis (or both). It is also interesting to find out what are the effects of smoking on the lung capacity.
